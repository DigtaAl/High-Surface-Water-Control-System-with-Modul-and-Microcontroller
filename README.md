## Overview

This repository presents a comparative analysis of two surface water control systems. The first system utilizes traditional components such as SCR modules, transformers, sensors, and relays, while the second system integrates a microcontroller (Arduino) for advanced control. The goal is to assess and compare the performance, efficiency, and practicality of both approaches in high-surface water control applications.

## Contents

- **/SCR-Control-System**: Contains the files and documentation related to the surface water control system based on SCR modules, transformers, sensors, and relays.

- **/Arduino-Control-System**: Houses the code, schematics, and explanations for the surface water control system implemented with Arduino microcontroller.

## Key Features

### SCR-Control-System

- Traditional control system using SCR modules and transformers.
- Utilizes sensors for monitoring water levels.
- Relay-based switching for water control.

### Arduino-Control-System

- Modern control system based on Arduino microcontroller.
- Programmed logic for precise water level management.
- Integration of additional sensors for enhanced monitoring.
- Comparative data logging for performance analysis.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the desired system folder (`/SCR-Control-System` or `/Arduino-Control-System`).
2. Follow the instructions in the respective README files for setup and implementation details.
